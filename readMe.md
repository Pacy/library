# Basic Library
A basic library web application (front- and backend)
Application is built with MEAN stack

>Basic library, is meant to handle the use cases of a library web application. This includes searching for medium they own, their availabilty, news from the library, checking borrow status own books.
>Furthermore, the idea would be to extended with borrow/return functions to emulate a library interaction with medium and the user. 

## Project Status
Work in progress, so far working
- a basic 'home' page including some news (news are hardcoded at the moment)
- crud operation for media and there respective sites


## Tech

Currently used :

- [MongoDB] - NoSQL Database
- [Angular] - client-side JavaScript framework
- [Express] - Node.js web framework
- [node.js] - JavaScript web server 

## Starting application
Currently used version:
- MongoDB 5.0.7
- Angular 13.3.1
- Express 4.17.3
- Node.js 14.15.0
 
For a compatability list refer to this this [github compatability list]

Clone this repository. Install the dependency (need npm for this)
``
npm install
``

Start mongoDB with mongod. (additional you can specify a database path)
``
mongod --dbpath="D:\data\db"
``

> TO DO
> have to add the indexes that need to be created here
>

Both, front- and backend, can be started together from the folder containing both projects with
``
npm start
``
or by using nagivating to them and then running the same command on each one.


## Reflection
This web application is meant to practice and improve my knowledge regarding building front and backend web application with the MEAN stack :)
Focus is actually on the front end, but backend logic and database take some time to get right. The whole project is built from scratch on my own.

The project is built on the go while trying to get more confindence in frontend developing skills.
Different challenges appear when working on the project, and new things can be learnt :D

For example that a monogDB index search combined with an $or operator, requires the other field to be indexed to work.


I guess, I could have written things here (or could start now), that I am learning while working on itðŸ¤”
// Update: create a private file for this now with some of them
